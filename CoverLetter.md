In my previous roles, I have gained extensive experience in various technologies and frameworks. At DBC, as a React Native Engineer, I have successfully worked on an international financial project allocated to Concepta Tech. Utilizing cutting-edge tools such as Expo, React Native, GraphQL, and TypeScript, I have played a key role in developing the project for the past four months.

Prior to that, as a React Engineer at Foursys, I contributed to a Siemens Healthineers project, where I gained proficiency in Redux.js, Next.js, SASS, Docker, API REST, JavaScript, and React.js. These experiences have strengthened my ability to develop robust and scalable web applications.

During my tenure as a Project Manager and developer at Alpha Software, I worked on various projects, utilizing Redux.js, SASS, .NET Web API, JavaScript, React.js, and React Native. These opportunities allowed me to enhance my skills in project management, while also honing my technical expertise.

In terms of education, I hold a Technologist degree in System Analysis from the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Rond√¥nia (IFRO). This program provided me with a strong foundation in software development principles and practices.

I am proficient in multiple languages, including Portuguese (native), English (C1), and Spanish (B1), enabling me to effectively communicate and collaborate in diverse professional environments.

I am confident that my technical expertise and extensive experience in software development make me a strong candidate for this position. I am eager to contribute my skills and dedication to producing high-quality software solutions that meet your company's objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my qualifications align with your company's needs in more detail.
